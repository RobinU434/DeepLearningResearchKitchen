# Project

Objectives:

- For a new (more realistic) DL problem (e.g. a ViT/nanoGPT/diffusion model/AlgoPerf workload) experiment with different learning rate schedules. Try to design one that reaches a competitive target in the least amount of time.
- Look into "infinite" learning rate schedules (ones where the training step budget is unknown).
